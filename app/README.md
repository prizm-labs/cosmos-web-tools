# A Quickstart Boilerplate for Big AngularJS x Parse apps


An opinionated, battle-tested boilerplate for building large, powerful, serverless apps with AngularJS and Parse.



Built by guys who would rather be coding than [shopping](http://www.getbrandid.com)

### Live Demo and Documentation

### Who is this for?
Maybe you're already using Parse for mobile and you need a web presence now too.

Maybe you’re an AngularJS beginner and you want to learn how big AngularJS apps are built.

Maybe you're already familiar with AngularJS or Backbone and you need a solid architecture that will scale nicely as your app scales.

Maybe you're at a hackathon, and you need to quickly launch a dynamic web app that requires user sessions and data storage.

### Why we made this

Thanks to [Mahmoud](https://twitter.com/mahmoudimus) from [Balanced](https://github.com/balanced) for the inspiration to be more open.

-------

We love [Parse](http://parse.com) and AngularJS. We hate servers. Whilst building [BRANDiD](http://www.getbrandid.com) we developed some best practices around this stack, so we decided to open source it here. We even talked about it on the [Parse Blog](http://blog.parse.com/2013/10/17/guest-post-parse-x-angular-js-boilerplate/).

This boilerplate is a quickstart for large, maintainable, database enabled AngularJS apps. Let us know what we can improve via twitter [@spacenick](http://www.twitter.com/spacenick) and [@arush](http://www.twitter.com/arush)!

### Installation Instructions

1. Install node - http://nodejs.org/
1. Install grunt v0.4.x - http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

1. Install coffee-script `npm install -g coffee-script`
1. Make sure you have compass installed (http://compass-style.org/install/)
1. Make sure you are running the latest version of Node (we can't assure you this is gonna work on older versions of Node)
1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:brandid/parse-angular-demo.git`
1. Switch out your Parse keys in **ParseServices.js** (see below)
1. Switch out your Facebook App ID in **ParseServices.js**
1. Remove our [GoSquared](www.gosquared.com) tracking snippet from **index.html**
1. `cd parse-angular-demo`

### Wire up your own Parse backend in seconds
##### [client/app/scripts/services/ParseServices.js](https://github.com/brandid/parse-angular-demo/blob/master/client/app/scripts/services/ParseServices.js)

    // pro-tip: swap these keys out for PROD keys automatically on deploy using grunt-replace
    
    ...
    Parse.initialize("***APP ID***", "***JAVASCRIPT KEY***");
    ...

### Contribute

* Angular Backbone bindings for easier forms with Parse SDK (60% complete - @spacenick)
* Better documentation/video on how to customise queries like ParseQueryTableViewController
* Convert to [grunt-takana](https://github.com/mechio/grunt-takana) instead of grunt-contrib-compass (too slow)
* Tests (help!)
* Upgrade to Bootstrap 3.0.x
* Docs and examples on User session handling
* Docs and examples on ACL to protect against [this](https://www.webniraj.com/2013/08/01/using-the-parse-javascript-sdk-be-careful/) Parse API design decision. For those who need to retrospectively protect their database, read [this thread](https://www.parse.com/questions/cant-update-user-acl-on-the-dashboard-cloud-code-w-master-key)
* Open source the BRANDiD [Customer.io](www.customer.io) Cloud Code module to securely trigger transactional emails with unlimited custom data (You cannot send large payloads with the Customer.io JS SDK)
* Include [AngularFirebasePatch](https://github.com/spacenick/angular-firebase-patch) for real-time support, which is our simple alternative to [AngularFire](www.angularfire.com)
